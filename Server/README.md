# GroupChatServer
GroupChatServer is the server-side part of the GroupChat.  It controls passing messages to each user, sending messages, receiving them, when users leave and join.  Basically just all of your general fun server stuff.  This is the second part to my AP Computer Science in Java final project.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Have the latest version of Java installed.  Requires a minimum version of Java 8.

### Usage
If you are on MacOS/Linux, run the 'launch.sh' file.
If you are running Windows, run the 'launch.bat' file.
Do not run the jar file directly.  It just becomes a huge hassle
